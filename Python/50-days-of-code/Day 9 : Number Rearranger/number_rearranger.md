## Day 9

**Rearrange the number**

To complete this challenge, write a function that accepts a number as a parameter. The function should return a number thatâ€™s the difference between the **largest** and **smallest** numbers that the **digits can form** in the number.

For example, if the parameter is `213`, the function should return `198`, which is the result of `123` subtracted from `321`.
