## Day 8

**Tic Tac Toe blocker**

In this Python challenge, write a function thatâ€™ll accept **two numbers**. These numbers will represent a position on a tic-tac-toe board. They can be `0` through `8`, where `0` is the top-left spot, and `8` is the bottom-right spot.

These parameters are two marks on the tic-tac-toe board. The function should return the **number of the spot** that can block these two spots from winning the game.
