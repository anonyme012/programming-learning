## Day 18

**Flatten a list**

Write a function named `flatten` that takes a single parameter, a list of lists and flattens it into a one-dimensional list.

For example, calling `flatten([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])` should return the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

You can assume the input is a list in **2 dimensions** maximum.
