## Day 19

**Writing short code**

Define a function named `convert` that takes a **list of numbers** as its only parameter and **returns** a list of each number **converted to a string**.

For example, calling `convert([1, 2, 3])` should return `["1", "2", "3"]`.

**What makes this tricky is that your function body must only contain a single line of code !**
