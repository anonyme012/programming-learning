## Day 7 : 

**Shadow sentences**

For the purpose of this challenge, shadow sentences are sentences where every word is the same length and order but without any of the same letters. Write a function that accepts two parameters that may or may not be shadows of each other. The function should return `True` if they are and `False` if they arenâ€™t.

An example would be `they are round` and `fold two times`, which are shadow sentences, while `his friends` and `our company` are not because both contain an `r`.
